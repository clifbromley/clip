## Clip

A set of tools to make managing remote git branches easy and fun

### git clip
Due to the collaborative nature of git; over time one begins to accumulate
quite a few branches local and remote branches. Keeping track of what branch
needs to be merged, has already been merged, and what branches need a pull can
tax the little grey cells (aka the brain).

``git clip`` is designed to help eleviate this pain by providing a clear view
of all your local and remote branches.
